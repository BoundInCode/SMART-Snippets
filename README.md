SMART Snippets
==============

Important
=========
SMART Snippets is still very early in development.  There is *A LOT* left to do.  At the moment, however, it is both functional and bugfree.  This is exciting because now I can finally think seriously about where I see this plugin going in the future.

SMART Snippets is a *new* [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/2) plugin that aims to enhance your overall coding experience.  With SMART Snippets, You can now use Python to *dynamically* create snippets.  Need to quickly timestamp your code?  Unfortunately, ST2's default snippets are static.  So you could spend your time trudging through Sublime Text's API, wasting precious hours to do something so trivial... but that shouldn't be your job.  You have your own work to do.  Instead, let SMART Snippets handle it.  Not only does this plugin let you execute Python code within a snippet, it provides a simpler syntax for gettings things done.

Not a Pythonista?
================
Don't fret.  Not only is Python insanely simple and readable, SMART Snippets keeps everything you need within reach.  With direct access to Python libraries and the Sublime Text API, you'll be manipulating your code ease.
